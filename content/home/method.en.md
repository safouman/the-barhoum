I combine developmental coaching, narrative therapy, and ritual design to build coherent leadership from the inside out.

Each session begins with attentive listening to surface the hidden tension, then shifts into structured reflection that exposes the gap between your values and daily behavior.

We close by translating insight into practice: shared language, deliberate experiments, and gentle accountability that keep the work alive between meetings.

It’s a practice of self-leadership—clarity, alignment, and compassion woven into the rhythm of everyday decisions.
